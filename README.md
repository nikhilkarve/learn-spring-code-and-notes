1 . Why is coupling important?
Coupling is important everywhere.
 - An engine is tightly coupled to a car. 
 - A wheel is loosely coupled to a car.
 - You can take a laptop anywhere you go.
 - A computer, on the other hand, is a little bit more difficult to move.

Coupling is even more important in building great software.
- Only thing constant in technology is change.
  - Business requirements change.
  - Frameworks change.
  - Code changes.

Hence, we want loose coupling as much as possible. 
We want to make functional changes with less code changes as possible.
